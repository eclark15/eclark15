I am a BI and Data Analytics Consultant at Bosch. My background is in Marketing Analytics and I also have a Master's in Data Science. I am a member of the [Women in Data](https://www.womenindata.org/) Community and love to support diversity in the workplace, especially in data-related fields. Feel free to check out my data science projects and let me know if you have questions or want to connect 🙂 

In my spare time I enjoy... 
* 🏐 Playing Beach Volleyball 
* 🌄 Going on Hikes
* 🎧 Listening to Podcasts
* ✈️ Traveling 
* 📚 Reading
