## Hi there! 👋 My name is Emily Clark

I am a BI and Data Analytics Consultant 💻, my background is in digital analytics and marketing 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 and I have a Master's in Data Science 📚. 

My [Sparketype](https://sparketype.com/) is a Maven (Primary) and Scientist (Secondary) which means I live to learn and solve problems

I am a member of the [Women in Data](https://www.womenindata.org/) Community and love to support diversity in the workplace, especially in data-related fields. Feel free to check out my data science projects and let me know if you have questions or want to connect 🙂
